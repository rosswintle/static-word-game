                <p>This is a 2-player word game. You will probably recognise it. I'm not allowed to call it that though.
                </p>
                <p>The game is totally free, and requires no login.</p>
                <p>It works by giving you a website link once you have played your move. You send this link to your
                    opponent.
                    They then take their turn, and send you a link back!
                </p>
                <h3>Beginning a game</h3>
                <p>To start a game, just open this page and, if you don't see a new game, click "New game".</p>
                <h3>Playing a move</h3>
                <p>To play a move:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click or tap on the board where you want to start placing tiles.</li>
                    <li>Clicking or tapping the start point again switches between horizontal and vertical placement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Click or tap on your tiles to place them on the board.</li>
                    <li>You can drag and drop tiles on your "rack", but not onto the board.</li>
                    <li>Click "Clear" to clear your move and return tiles to your rack.</li>
                    <li>Click "Skip/Swap" to skip your turn and swap tiles.</li>
                    <li>Click "Play" to submit your move.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Passing play to your opponent</h3>
                <p>Once you have played your move, you will be given a link to send to your opponent. Use the "Copy link
                    to clipboard" button to copy the link. You can then paste it into a message or email.</p>
                <p>Your opponent will then take their turn, and send you a link back.</p>
                <p>This works best using an instant messenger like iMessage or WhatsApp.</p>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is currently no checking of words against a dictionary. If you dispute a move
                        then let your opponent know and ask them to play a different move using the last
                        link you sent them.</li>
                    <li>The game is currently limited to two players.</li>
                </ul>
